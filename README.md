Rubik's Cube Tutorial - Layer-by-Layer Method
Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Tutorial repository!
This repository contains a straightforward, easy-to-follow, layer-by-layer method to solve the Rubik’s Cube using minimal memorization and clear, intuitive steps.

Method Overview
This method breaks down the Rubik’s Cube solving process into distinct, manageable subsets with clear goals:

Minimal memorization required

Focus on intuitive understanding and pattern recognition

Can solve any scrambled cube

Layer-by-layer approach: solve the cube starting from the first layer to the last
| Letter | Meaning    | Turn Direction                  |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| R      | Right face | Plain letter = Clockwise        |
| L      | Left face  | `'` (prime) = Counter-clockwise |
| U      | Up face    | `2` = Double turn               |
| F      | Front face |                                 |
| B      | Back face  |                                 |
| D      | Down face  |                                 |
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Daisy (First Layer)
Gather the white edges around the yellow center on the top face.

This step is intuitive; start with easy edge pieces and proceed to more difficult ones.

2. Cross (First Layer)
Match the other color on each white edge with the center color of the same color.

Use bottom layer turns to align edges.

Once matched, perform an F2 turn to bring edges to the bottom.

3. Corners (First Layer)
Position white corners above their correct locations by turning the bottom layers.

Use the algorithms below repeatedly until all corners are solved:

Spin Right: R U R’ U’
Spin Left: L’ U’ L U
4. Second Layer
Match the front color of a second layer edge with the center color.

Rotate the bottom two layers to position the edge.

Apply the correct algorithm depending on edge direction:

U  or  U’
5. Top Yellow Cross (Last Layer)
Use the Line and Angle cases with the F’ and double F turns to form the yellow cross.

6. Positioning Last Layer Corners
Flip the cube so white is on top.

Find a corner to twist and position it at the bottom right.

Repeat twisting until yellow faces down.

Rotate the bottom layer to bring next corner to bottom right and repeat.

7. Positioning Last Layer Edges
Use adjacent and diagonal swaps to position edges correctly.

Apply sequences to swap edges until solved.

Algorithms Summary
Spin Right: R U R’ U’

Spin Left: L’ U’ L U

Top Layer Line & Angle: Use F’ and double F turns

Last Layer Corner Twisting: Follow instructions to twist corners with cube flipped

Positioning Corners and Edges: Use adjacent and diagonal swaps sequences as explained
